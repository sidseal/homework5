For this project, we had to create a Work Day Planner, that would do a couple of things. Firstly, it should display the current day, date, and time. The time blocks should be for the work day 9am-5pm. Every hour should have an input area for the user to add a task and a save button. If saved, the task should persist to show up on the page, if refreshed. Lastly, the time blocks should be color coded, to signify if that hour is in the past, present, or future.
